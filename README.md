=========

Online implementation of the [COS PyDocX project](https://github.com/tonyteate/pydocx):

> pydocx is a parser that breaks down the elements of a docxfile and converts them into different markup languages. Right now, HTML is supported. Markdown and LaTex will be available soon. You can extend any of the available parsers to customize it to your needs. You can also create your own class that inherits DocxParser to create your own methods for a markup language not yet supported.
